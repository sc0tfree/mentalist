Mentalist is a graphical tool for custom wordlist generation. It utilizes common human paradigms for constructing passwords and can output the full wordlist as well as rules compatible with [Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat) and [John the Ripper](http://www.openwall.com/john).
<br>

For more information on installing and using Mentalist, please **[visit the wiki](https://www.github.com/sc0tfree/mentalist/wiki)**.

## Note on ‘Slang and Expletives’ List

I apologize to anyone offended by the built-in list of `Slang & Expletives`, compiled from a variety of sources. The reality is that some people use truly heinous words for their credentials and this list is meant to help crack them.

## Future Work

* Ability to scrape sites as an attribute in the Base Words node.
* Add dictionaries and lists for more languages
* Add UK post codes to Append/Prepend Nodes
* Option to perform de-duplication of Base Words
* Mentalist Chain file differencing
